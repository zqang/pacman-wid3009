Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Red Riding Hood. She lived in a small village near the forest with her family. One day, her mother asked her to take some food and medicine to her grandmother who lived in the deep forest. Red Riding Hood happily agreed and set off on her journey.

On the way to her grandmother's house, Red Riding Hood met a cunning wolf who asked her where she was going. Red Riding Hood innocently told the wolf about her mission. The wolf pretended to be friendly and suggested taking a shortcut to her grandmother's house. Red Riding Hood, unaware of the wolf's true intentions, followed the shortcut.

When Red Riding Hood reached her grandmother's house, she found the wolf already there. The wolf had eaten her grandmother and disguised himself as her. He tried to trick Red Riding Hood into coming closer, but she was suspicious. She asked the wolf questions about her grandmother's appearance and the wolf could not answer them correctly. Red Riding Hood realized that the wolf was not her grandmother and screamed for help.

Hearing Red Riding Hood's scream, a woodcutter who was passing by came to her rescue. He chased away the wolf and saved Red Riding Hood and her grandmother. From that day on, Red Riding Hood learned to be cautious of strangers and never to talk to or follow them.

The end.
