# PacManEngineAssignment1
Main Code Base for Ms. Pac-Man Vs Ghost Team Competition

1.	Download and extract the zip file.

2.	Follow the setup instructions.

3.	Run the game a few times. You should notice that you will get a different score every time. Record the scores.

4.	Implement a new tree search algorithm for the Pac-Man (i.e. “YourSearchController.java" inside the folder “TreeSearchMsPacMan-master\src\main\java\examples\StarterPacMan”). 

You can use any search algorithm: tree-search, reinforcement learning, neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc.

You can implement more than one search algorithm if you have time.

5.	Test your new search algorithms several times and record the scores.

6.	Write a short report (< 5 pages). It should answer the following questions:

a.	Describe your search algorithm. What parameters are used (i.e. number of layers, number of nodes), how long does it take to train, etc. \\

b.	What inputs were used by your search algorithm.

c.	Does your algorithm achieve higher or lower score than the default algorithm?

7.	Repackage your codes into a zip file and submit to my email along with the report.
